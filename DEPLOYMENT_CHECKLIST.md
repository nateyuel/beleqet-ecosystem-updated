## 4. Webhook Registration

### 4.1 Stripe

- [ ] Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint
  - URL: `https://api.beleqet.com/payments/stripe/webhook`
  - Events to listen: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `charge.refunded`
- [ ] Copy the generated signing secret into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- [ ] Test event delivery from the Stripe dashboard

### 4.2 PayPal

- [ ] PayPal Developer Dashboard → My Apps → Webhooks → Add webhook
  - URL: `https://api.beleqet.com/payments/paypal/webhook`
  - Events: `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED`, `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED`, `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.ACTIVATED`, `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED`
- [ ] Copy the Webhook ID into `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`
- [ ] Send a test notification from the PayPal dashboard and confirm 200 response

---

## 5. Security Checklist

| # | Check | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 5.1 | Stripe webhook endpoint validates signature before processing | ✅ |
| 5.2 | PayPal webhook endpoint validates event before processing | ✅ |
| 5.3 | `AllExceptionsFilter` is globally registered (no raw stack traces in responses) | ✅ |
| 5.4 | PII fields (`email`, `phone`, `token`) stripped from Stripe metadata | ✅ |
| 5.5 | DB Index Master endpoints require `ADMIN` role (JWT guard confirmed) | ✅ |
| 5.6 | Helmet headers enabled in `main.ts` | ✅ |
| 5.7 | CORS restricted to known frontend origins | ✅ |
| 5.8 | Rate limiting enabled on payment and webhook routes | ✅ |
| 5.9 | No secrets in logs (check `AllExceptionsFilter` redaction) | ✅ |

> **Code review notes (2026-07-06):**
> - 5.1 ✅ `StripeService.handleWebhook` calls `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent` and throws `UnprocessableEntityException` on failure — verified in unit tests.
> - 5.2 ✅ `PaypalService.handleWebhook` calls `paypal.notification.webhookEvent.verify` when `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID` is set — verified in unit tests.
> - 5.3 ✅ `AllExceptionsFilter` registered globally in `main.ts` via `app.useGlobalFilters(new AllExceptionsFilter(...))`.
> - 5.4 ✅ `StripeService.sanitiseMetadata` strips `email`, `phone`, `name`, `address`, `telegramId` keys — covered by unit tests.
> - 5.5 ✅ `DbIndexMasterController` decorated with `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)` and `@Roles('ADMIN')`.
> - 5.6 ✅ `helmet()` applied in `main.ts`.
> - 5.7 ✅ `app.enableCors({ origin: ... })` configured in `main.ts`.
> - 5.8 ✅ `ThrottlerGuard` applied globally via `ThrottlerModule.forRoot` in `app.module.ts`.
> - 5.9 ✅ `AllExceptionsFilter` redacts stack traces; `StripeService.handleStripeError` logs internally, never exposes raw Stripe messages.

## 6. Smoke Tests (Post-Deploy)

Run these against the production/staging environment after deployment:

### 6.1 Stripe

```bash
# Create a payment intent (test card)
curl -X POST https://api.beleqet.com/payments/stripe/intent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 100, "currency": "USD"}'
# Expected: 201 with { id, clientSecret, status }
```

### 6.2 PayPal

```bash
# Create a PayPal order
curl -X POST https://api.beleqet.com/payments/paypal/order \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 10, "currency": "USD"}'
# Expected: 201 with { id, approvalUrl, status }
```

### 6.3 DB Index Master

```bash
# Full report (admin only)
curl -X GET https://api.beleqet.com/admin/db-index/report \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_JWT>"
# Expected: 200 with { totalIndexes, unusedIndexCount, suggestions, ... }

# EXPLAIN query
curl -X POST https://api.beleqet.com/admin/db-index/explain \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_JWT>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sql": "SELECT id FROM jobs WHERE status = $1"}'
# Expected: 200 with { plan, summary }
```

### 6.4 Wallet currency conversion

```bash
# Verify the /payments/stripe/currencies endpoint lists ETB
curl https://api.beleqet.com/payments/stripe/currencies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT>"
# Expected: 200 with array containing { code: "ETB", ... }
```

## 7. Monitoring & Alerting

- [ ] Confirm error rate alert is configured for `POST /payments/**` (threshold: > 1 % 5xx in 5 min)
- [ ] Confirm latency alert for payment endpoints (threshold: p99 > 3 s)
- [ ] Stripe Dashboard → monitor failed payment intents
- [ ] PayPal Dashboard → monitor failed captures
- [ ] Application logs shipped to centralised log store (CloudWatch / ELK)

---

## 8. Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise post-deployment:

1. **Immediate:** Set feature flag / disable payment routes at the load balancer level.
2. **Database:** Run `prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20260706000001_global_payment_gateway` if migration must be reversed. _(Confirm this is safe — migration should be additive only.)_
3. **Code:** Revert the merge commit and redeploy the previous release tag.
4. **Webhooks:** Disable the new webhook endpoints in Stripe and PayPal dashboards to prevent duplicate processing.
